        - bug fix. values returned from phase() were incorrect by the amount
	  of timezone offset between localtime to gmtime.  Values were based
	  on the use of localtime() instead of gmtime() in jtime(). jtime()
	  is now much simplified, and jdate() has been eliminated.
	- phasehunt() rewritten, but still returning phases from the wrong
	  lunation, skipping the correct dates. behavior slightly changed.

	  the bug reports.
	- bug fix. daytosecs() was causing new phasehunt() error. jdaytosecs()
	  is now much simplified, and jhms() has been eliminated.
