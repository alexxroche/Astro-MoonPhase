        - bug fix. values returned from phase() were incorrect by the amount
	  of timezone offset between localtime to gmtime.  Values were based
	  on the use of localtime() instead of gmtime() in jtime(). jtime()
	  is now much simplified, and jdate() has been eliminated.
	- phasehunt() rewritten, but still returning phases from the wrong
	  lunation, skipping the correct dates. behavior slightly changed.

	- bug fix. phasehunt() meanphase() and jyear() rewritten using code
	  from moontool.c version 3.1. Thanks to John Walker and Ron Hitchens
	  for the source code.  Thanks to Janto Trappe and Douglas Clifton for
	  the bug reports.
	- bug fix. daytosecs() was causing new phasehunt() error. jdaytosecs()
	  is now much simplified, and jhms() has been eliminated.
